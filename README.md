# SDF11 Portfolio Piece

## Project Overview
For this project, I was entrusted with developing a landing page using Tailwind CSS, based on a pre-designed layout. This experience not only allowed me to execute a given design with precision but also deepened my proficiency with Tailwind. Through this project, I honed my ability to translate visual concepts into responsive, scalable code, further solidifying my expertise in modern CSS frameworks.
